# Instagram-Unfollowing-List
A program that creates a list of users who you follow but do not follow you back without the use
of the Instagram API.

Requirements before running:
1. Download chromedriver (latest stable version)
-Create a path to chromedriver
2. Input your account credentials into the variables "username" and "password"

Note:
The program is slow for users with hundreds of followers due to the fact that the follower/following 
list box does not load every name immediately. Thus the program must manually scroll through the 
refreshing box until it reaches the end and loads all the names into a temporary list.

Enjoy!
